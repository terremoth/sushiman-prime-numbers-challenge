# sushiman-prime-numbers-challenge
Some Brazilian Federal University algorithm challenge - I made the Unix Way with PHP

Problem description, if I remember well:
- there is a sushiman who likes a lot prime numbers
- he would like a program to generate all prime numbers with a fixed length 
- for example: 4 - it will generate all prime numbers from 1000 to 9999
  
I made this solution using PHP + Unix Philosophies/Rules

### TODO
- handle `$argv` with `getopt(...)`
- handle input errors like strings or non positive number values
- optimize genprime.php for algorithm to print faster
